# Our Development Principles  

We follow clear rules when creating our software to ensure that each program is convenient, functional, and reliable.  

### 🔹 Solidity  
Programs should be minimalist, user-friendly, and pleasant to use. No clutter—only what the user truly needs.  

### ⚙️ Configurability  
Maximum freedom in settings! Most parameters can be adjusted to personal preference so that everyone can tailor the program to their needs.  

### 📴 Autonomy  
Everything that can work without the internet should work without it. If the connection drops, the program should not turn into useless junk—it must remain functional in any situation.
